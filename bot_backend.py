Data dictionary:

Sample data:
{sample_df.to_string(index=False)}

User question: "{question}"

Please return a Python code block that:
- Uses only the data in the DataFrame `df`
- Defines one or more result variables (e.g., `result`, `top_campaigns`, etc.)
- Avoids any placeholder or imaginary variables
- Always wraps string values in quotes
- Does NOT include print() or display() statements
- Does NOT include import statements (those are already handled)
- Handles edge cases like division by zero or missing values
