When asked which campaign is "performing the best", consider metrics like:
- Conversions (higher is better)
- Click-through rate (CTR = Clicks / Impressions)
- Cost per acquisition (CPA = Spend / Conversions, lower is better)
- Return on ad spend (ROAS = Revenue / Spend)

Choose a metric based on what is available in the data. If multiple apply, pick the most meaningful one and explain why.
